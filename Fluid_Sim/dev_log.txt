Color schema
I started with the simulation color as I thought it would be the easiest to solve. 
The most challenging part of this task was my lack of knowledge of the Python language. 
I found out that you can change the color scheme of the pyplot with cmap. 
It is possible to change in figure or axis but I decided to take the second option since
there was an 'issue' with the labels on the y-axis since they were inverted,
so I decided to change the y-axis labels and cmap schema.

Multiple velocity and density sources
This was the second task I solved since there was already examples in the sourde code.
Then I just implemented the configuration for them; Velocity, Density, Config and
Vector2D classes. With the Config class I realized that receiving a json was the best option.
I decided that the Config class would store the sources and could apply them to the simulation.

Animate velocity forces
I left these last two tasks at the end as I thought they were the most complex to implement.
To animate the speed forces, I implemented a method that we are currently reviewing in our
stereography subject and that is affine transformations. So I decided to create the animate() method
in Velocity, which would be called each time the force was applied to the simulation,
depending on the current speed animation, the Vector2D would be multiplied by a matrix.

Object presence
This was the one that took me the longest to solve and it is because I was thinking that objects have
higher density and just because of that the simulation would behave like it was much more difficult to
move the 'molecules' in this area but after several experiments it turns out that this would not be the solution.
Once I realized this, I wondered what would make the 'molecules' stay still and the first answer was
remove the density of the area to avoid any movement. When I implemented this solution and it seemed to work
I decided that I would remove the density in all areas of the objects, then apply speeds and densities, take a step
and at the end I would apply density to all areas of the objects once more so that they would have color in the simulation.
This seemed to do the trick so this was the final solution.
